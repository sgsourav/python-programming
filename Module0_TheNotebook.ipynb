    "Python is a fun language to learn, and really easy to pick up even if you are new to programming. In fact, quite often, Python is easier to pick up if you do not have any programming experience whatsoever. Python is high level programming language, targeted at students and professionals from diverse backgrounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has two flavors -- Python 2 and Python 3. This set of examples are in Python 3, written and executed in the beautifully simple IDE Jupyter Notebook. Note that Jupyter has set up a `localhost:8888` server to render the notebook in your computer's browser. It can render anything now! Once you are familiar with the Jupyter Notebook environment, and the basic Python syntax on this page, feel free to explore the other Modules in this repository.\n",
